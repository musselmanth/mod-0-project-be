## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  >  * Mistakes are critical to learning so we shouldn't let them discourage us from continuing.
  >  * If we measure our growth off of the growth of others we often lose track of how much we've actually grown.


2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  > I think the fact that I'm quitting my job and going to Turing at least demonstrates that I have a growth mindset a little.
  > There are definitely some specific "soft" skills that I sometimes think I'll never improve on and have more of a fixed mindset with, but I'm hoping I can change that.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

  >  A conditional statement is a statement which evaluates as either _true_ or _false_.
  >  Three examples:
  >  * `5 > 2` _true_
  >  * `5 != 5` _false_
  >  * `1 == 2 || 3 == 3` _true_


4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

  >   We would use an if-statement if we only want to run a block of code if a certain condition is met.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

  ```Ruby
  if some_condition
    do_this
  end
  ```

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

  >  We can use 'else-if' and 'else' statements to create multiple conditions with one if-statement block.

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

  ```Ruby
  if some_condition
    do_this
  elsif some_other_condition
    do_this
  else
    do_this
  end
  ```
